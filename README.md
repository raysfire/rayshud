A hud for Team Fortress 2.

About
-------

A simplistic yet bold hud for TF2 made to cut out a lot of clutter included that of the stock hud. It includes both a 6s and 16v16 scoreboard that can be toggled by changing to and from the minimal mode, and a range of various vivid colors associated with both low health as well as ammo.

To Download
--------

Click the green `Clone or Download` button at the top of the page and then `Download Zip` in order to download the most recent version of my hud! It should be at the top of the page. 

To Install
--------

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. Press `Download Zip` on Github. This will download `rayshud-master.zip`
2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf`
3. Create a folder named `custom` if it does not already exist
4. Extract .zip file contents into `custom` directory. You may rename the top folder whatever you wish.

The final structure should resemble the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── rayshud
        ├── materials
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        ├── sound
        └── ...
```
