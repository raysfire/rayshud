A hud for Team Fortress 2.

About
-------

A simplistic yet bold hud for TF2 made to cut out a lot of clutter included that of the stock hud. It includes both a 6s and 16v16 scoreboard that can be toggled by changing to and from the minimal mode, and a range of various vivid colors associated with both low health as well as ammo. 

It was originally created for myself as a fun side project to do while I wasn't doing schoolwork, but I've been asked by others to release it, so here it is. However, this is very much still under construction, and does NOT currently have any edits for MvM. This means that while MvM may still be playable, a lot of the features will either be not visible, or cut off.

To Download
--------

Click the green `Clone or Download` button at the top of the page and then `Download Zip` in order to download the most recent version of my hud! It should be at the top of the page. 

To Install
--------

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. Press `Download Zip` on Github. This will download `rayshud-master.zip`
2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf`
3. Create a folder named `custom` if it does not already exist
4. Extract .zip file contents into `custom` directory. You may rename the top folder whatever you wish.

The final structure should resemble the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── rayshud
        ├── materials
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        ├── sound
        └── ...
```
