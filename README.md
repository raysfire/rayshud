scruffshud
=======

A fork of <a href="https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud">rayshud</a>, a Team Fortress 2 hud.

About
-------

I made this hud because there wasn't really a hud out there that fit me perfectly. The reason I posted it on github is anytime i want to check my edits or merge rays changes with mine i could with ease.

To-Do List
--------

* Update hud to custom standard
* Finish hud README

To Download
--------

Click the "ZIP" button with the cloud next to it in order to download the most recent version of my hud! It should be at the top of the page. 

To Install
--------

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. Press `Download Zip` on Github. This will download `scruffs-master.zip`
2. Navigate to 
	Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf`
	Mac:     `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf`
3. Create a folder named `custom` if it does not already exist
4. Extract .zip file contents into `custom` directory. You may rename the top folder whatever you wish.

The final structure should resemble the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── scruffs
        ├── materials
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        ├── sound
        └── ...
```
