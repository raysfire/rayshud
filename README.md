A HUD for Team Fortress 2.

About
-------

A simplistic yet bold hud for TF2 made to cut out a lot of clutter included that of the stock hud. It includes both a 6s and 16v16 scoreboard that can be toggled by changing to and from the minimal mode, and a range of various vivid colors associated with both low health as well as ammo.

To Download
--------

Click the green `Clone or Download` button at the top of the page and then `Download ZIP` in order to download the most recent version of my hud! It should be at the top of the page. 

To Install
--------

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. Press `Download ZIP` on Github. This will download `rayshud-master.zip`
2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom`
3. Extract .zip file contents into the `custom` folder.
4. Ensure that the final file structure should resembles the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── rayshud
        ├── customizations
        ├── materials
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        ├── sound
        ├── README.md
        └── info.vdf
```

Help/Support
--------
* If you have a MAC, replace the current fonts (CERBETICA, CERBETICA_EDITED) with those that have a "-MAC" suffix. If you don't do this, the in-game font will not render properly.
* If you're on a 4:3 resolution, (800x600, 1024x768, etc.), then after installing raysHUD, copy the contents of `rayshud/customizations/4_by_3_ratio` folder into `rayshud/resource/ui`.
* If you've found a bug, need help or have a suggestion - either [open a support ticket here on GitHub](https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud/issues/new) or [make a post on the Steam Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/rayshud).
