A HUD for Team Fortress 2.

About
-------

A simplistic yet bold hud for TF2 made to cut out a lot of clutter included that of the stock hud. It includes both a 6s and 16v16 scoreboard that can be toggled by changing to and from the minimal mode, and a range of various vivid colors associated with both low health as well as ammo.

2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom`
3. Extract .zip file contents into the `custom` folder.
4. Ensure that the final file structure should resembles the following:
```

        ├── customizations
        ├── materials
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts

        ├── README.md
        └── info.vdf
```

Help/Support
--------
* If you can't see player health as Spy or the Medic, disable floating TargetID health by inputting `tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 1` into the console or disabling the option in Advanced Options.
* If you've found a bug or have a suggestion, [open a ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud/issues/new) or [make a post on the Steam Group Forums](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/rayshud/discussions).
