A HUD for Team Fortress 2.

About
-------

A simplistic yet bold hud for TF2 made to cut out a lot of clutter included that of the stock hud. It includes both a 6s and 16v16 scoreboard that can be toggled by changing to and from the minimal mode, and a range of various vivid colors associated with both low health as well as ammo.

To Install
--------

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. extract zip @ ```tf/custom```

note: If you've found a bug, you're on your own. sorry.

Help/Support
--------
* If you can't see player health as Spy or the Medic, disable floating TargetID health by inputting `tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 1` into the console or disabling the option in Advanced Options.
* If you've found a bug or have a suggestion, [open a ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud/issues/new) or [make a post on the Steam Group Forums](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/rayshud/discussions).
