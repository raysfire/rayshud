A fork of <a href="https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud">rayshud</a>, a hud for Team Fortress 2.

About
-------


To-Do List
--------

* Finish hud README

Screenshots

Features (can be disabled)
-------

* A rainbow-colored flashing charge meter. 

This can be enabled by uncommenting all of the "Animate" lines under the event "HudMedicCharge" in HudAnimations_tf.txt in the scripts folder. Make sure to uncomment all of the lines in "HudMedicChargeStop", too!

* Low ammo colors.

This can be enabled by uncommenting all of the "Animate" lines under the event "HudLowAmmoPulse" in HudAnimations_tf.txt in the scripts folder. Make sure to uncomment all of the lines in "HudLowAmmoPulseStop", too!

To Download
--------

Click the "ZIP" button with the cloud next to it in order to download the most recent version of my hud! It should be at the top of the page. 

To Install
--------

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! Never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

1. Press `Download Zip` on Github. This will download `scruffs-master.zip`
2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf`
3. Create a folder named `custom` if it does not already exist
4. Extract .zip file contents into `custom` directory. You may rename the top folder whatever you wish.

The final structure should resemble the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── scruffs
        ├── materials
        ├── resource
        ├── scripts
        ├── sound
        └── ...
```
