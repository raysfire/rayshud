  A simplistic yet bold hud for TF2 made to cut out a lot of clutter included that of the stock hud. Comes with a range of various vivid colors associated with both low health as well as ammo to make important information easily accessible and noticeable.

Be sure to back up your old hud folder first! You never know when something might break, and it's always best to be prepared.

2. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom`
3. Extract .zip file contents into the `custom` folder.
4. Ensure that the final file structure resembles the following:
```
tf
└── custom
    └── rayshud
        ├── cfg
        ├── materials
